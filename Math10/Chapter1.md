## Chapter 1: Introduce to Statistic ##
# Statistic Is The Study of Data #

Thing we do with data:

Gather/collect data $\rightarrow$ Organize and Summarize $\rightarrow$ Analyze $\rightarrow$ Interpret
#
Definitions:

 |Population|Sample|
|:---:|:---:|
|A group of individual, object, measurement that we want to study|A representative subset of a population|
|Example:   The population of **ALL** De Anza College students enrolled in a recent quarter|Example:  A sample of De Anza college students, such as 200 randomly selected students|
#
**Variable: the *description in words* of the characteristuc of interst**
- Example of Variable: "the age of a De Anza College student"

**Data: the information collected about the variable for individuals in the population or sample**
- Example of Data: 19, 23, 42, 18, 22, 28, 31, 18, 21

The variable is a sentence explaining the question you are asking in order to obtain information,

The data are he information obtained as answers to the question.
#
After the data is collected, we use the data to calculate number that summarizes and describe the characteristic for the population or sample. This number is called a parameter or a statistic.
#
|Parameter|Statistic|
|:---:|:---:|
|A quantity that characterize some aspect of a **population**|A quantity that characterize some aspect of a **sample**|
|Examples of Parameters: |Examples of Statistics:|
|**PROPORTION**: 39% of **all** De Anza College students were over age 25|**PROPORTION**: 41% of a random **sample** of 200 students were over age 25| 
**AVERAGE**: The average age of **all** De Anza College students was 27.1 years|**AVERAGE**: The average age of a ransom **sample** of 200 De Anza College students was 28.3 years|
**MEDIAN**: Half of **all** De Anza College students were 22 years old or younger| **MEDIAN**: In a **sample** of 200 De Anza College, 50% of the students were 22 years old or younger|
#
Does a sample statistic always have the same numerical value as the population parameter? Why or why not?
  
    No, They use different data
#
Are sample statistics euqal for all samples taken from the sample population? Why or why not?

    No, different sample uses different data
____
## **EXAMPLE 1:** ## 
suppose we are studying the commutes of De Anza College students to school from home.

What is the population?

    All De Anza Students

Given one possible example of a sample: 

    Student who commutes by bus

Some examples of variables and data:

    Variable: "the distance that a (one, individual) student commutes to De Anza College"
    Data: 2.5 miles, 8.4 miles, 0.25 miles, 52 miles,..

    Variable: "how a De Anza student commutes to school"
    Data: car, car, bus, bike, walk, car, bus, bus, car, bike, car
____
### **Quantitative** ###
- **Quantitative Discrete:**
variable that has finite number of value ***can be counted***
  - Examples: days of week, monthes of year
- **Quantitative Continuous:** 
variable that has infinitely many values ***cannot be counted***
    - Examples: stock value, decimal $\pi$
- **Quantitative**(also called Categorical)**:**
variable that in ***Non-Numeric***, described by words
    - Examples: car brand, colour
___
## **LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT** ##
**N.O.I.R** (black in french)

**Nominal: qualitative data:**
"How a student commutes to school" or "a student's major"

**Ordinal: data that can be ranked:**
- 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, . . . last place, such as in a race or competition
- preference ratings such as 
  -  1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = indifferent, 4 = disagree, 5 = strongly disagree 
  -  where there is no set measurement associated with each of the different responses.

**Interval: data has constant differences for intercals,**

**But there is no *definite natural "0" value* that can be used as the base point for comparisons**
- ExampleL Temperature $\degree$Celsius or $\degree$Fahrenheit
  - These are aritary scales; comparisons differ when using $\degree$C versus $\degree$F
  - 80$\degree$F is approximately 26.7$\degree$C and 40$\degree$F is approximately 4.4$\degree$C
  - Is it twice as hot (80$\degree$F is two times 40$\degree$F) OR is it 6 times as hot (26.7$\degree$C is about 6 times 4.4$\degree$C)?

**Ratio: data has constant differences for interval**

**AND there is a natural "0" value that can be used as a base point for ration comparisons**
- Example: distance travelled from homw to school;
  - Asaf travels 3 miles and Ben travels 6 miles. Ben travels twice as far as Asaf
- Example: It took Tran 1.5 hours to do homework and took Li 3 hours to do homework.
  - Tran took half as long as Li to do homework.
- Distance, Weight, . . . 
___
## **EXAMPLE 2:** ## 
Identify the type of variable and data and identify the level of measurement:
#
a. Variable: "The distance that a (one, individual) student commutes to De Anza College"
Data: 2.5 miles, 8.4 miles, 0.25 miels, 52 miles, . . 

    Variable Type: Quantitative continuous
    LoM: Ratio

b. Variable: "The number of days per week that a student comes to campus"

Data: 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, . . .

    Variable Type: Quantitative Discrete
    LoM: Ratio

c. Variable: "How a De Anza student commutes to school"

Data: car, car, bus, bike, bus, walk, car, bus, bus, car, bike, car, bus

    Variable Type: Quantitative 
    LoM: Nominal

d. Variable: "Was your commute time this Friday (1) faster than, (2) same as, (3) slower than usual?"

Data: 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, . . .

    Variable Type: Qualitative 
    LoM: Ordinary
____
## **EXAMPLE 3:** ## 
1500 randomly selected registered voters in a large city are asked the following questions:
    
    what is your age?
    What is your annual incoms?    
    Do you intend to vote?  
    If you intend to vote, do you intend to vote in person or by absentee ballot?
A newspaper article discussing expected voter turnout reported that for this sample, the average annual income is $61,000, the average age is 44, 63% of the registered voters sampled intend to vote, 42% intend to vote by absentee ballot while 58% intend to vote in person at the poillingplace.
#

a.  Describe the sample:

    1500 randomly selected registered voters in a large city
#
b. What would be the appropriate target population for this sample?

    All of the registered voter in a large city
#
c. What are the variables? List each variable as quantitative or qualitative:

| The QUANTITATIVE variables are: | The QUALITATITIVE variables are: |
|:---:|:---:|
| Age | Intend to vote|
| Annual income | How to vote |
#
d. Make up examples of data that might have been given by somebody in the sample.

| Age | Income | Intend | How | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 25 | $90k | yes | In-person |
| 23 | $45k | No | | 
| 20 | $20k | Yes | Absentee ballot |
#
e. Are the values reported in the newspaper statistics or parameters? Exmplain.

    Statistic, because they are associated with a sample
