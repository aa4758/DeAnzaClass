## Chapter 1: Introduce to Statistic ##
# Statistic Is The Study of Data #

Thing we do with data:

Gather/collect data $\rightarrow$ Organize and Summarize $\rightarrow$ Analyze $\rightarrow$ Interpret

#

Definitions:

|Population|Sample|
|:---:|:---:|
|A group of individual, object, measurement that we want to study|A representative subset of a population|
|Example:   The population of **ALL** De Anza College students enrolled in a recent quarter|Example:  A sample of De Anza college students, such as 200 randomly selected students|

#

**Variable: the *description in words* of the characteristuc of interst**
- Example of Variable: "the age of a De Anza College student"

**Data: the information collected about the variable for individuals in the population or sample**
- Example of Data: 19, 23, 42, 18, 22, 28, 31, 18, 21

The variable is a sentence explaining the question you are asking in order to obtain information,

The data are he information obtained as answers to the question.

#

After the data is collected, we use the data to calculate number that summarizes and describe the characteristic for the population or sample. This number is called a parameter or a statistic.

#

|Parameter|Statistic|
|:---:|:---:|
|A quantity that characterize some aspect of a **population**|A quantity that characterize some aspect of a **sample**|
|Examples of Parameters: |Examples of Statistics:|
|**PROPORTION**: 39% of **all** De Anza College students were over age 25|**PROPORTION**: 41% of a random **sample** of 200 students were over age 25| 
**AVERAGE**: The average age of **all** De Anza College students was 27.1 years|**AVERAGE**: The average age of a ransom **sample** of 200 De Anza College students was 28.3 years|
**MEDIAN**: Half of **all** De Anza College students were 22 years old or younger| **MEDIAN**: In a **sample** of 200 De Anza College, 50% of the students were 22 years old or younger|

#

Does a sample statistic always have the same numerical value as the population parameter? Why or why not?
  
    No, They use different data

Are sample statistics euqal for all samples taken from the sample population? Why or why not?

    No, different sample uses different data
____
## **EXAMPLE 1:** ## 
suppose we are studying the commutes of De Anza College students to school from home.

What is the population?

    All De Anza Students

Given one possible example of a sample: 

    Student who commutes by bus

Some examples of variables and data:

    Variable: "the distance that a (one, individual) student commutes to De Anza College"
    Data: 2.5 miles, 8.4 miles, 0.25 miles, 52 miles,..

    Variable: "how a De Anza student commutes to school"
    Data: car, car, bus, bike, walk, car, bus, bus, car, bike, car
____
### **Quantitative** ###
- **Quantitative Discrete:**
variable that has finite number of value ***can be counted***
  - Examples: days of week, monthes of year
- **Quantitative Continuous:** 
variable that has infinitely many values ***cannot be counted***
    - Examples: stock value, decimal $\pi$
- **Quantitative**(also called Categorical)**:**
variable that in ***Non-Numeric***, described by words
    - Examples: car brand, colour
___
## **LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT** ##
**N.O.I.R** (black in french)

**Nominal: qualitative data:**
"How a student commutes to school" or "a student's major"

**Ordinal: data that can be ranked:**
- 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, . . . last place, such as in a race or competition
- preference ratings such as 
  -  1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = indifferent, 4 = disagree, 5 = strongly disagree 
  -  where there is no set measurement associated with each of the different responses.

**Interval: data has constant differences for intercals,**

**But there is no *definite natural "0" value* that can be used as the base point for comparisons**
- ExampleL Temperature $\degree$Celsius or $\degree$Fahrenheit
  - These are aritary scales; comparisons differ when using $\degree$C versus $\degree$F
  - 80$\degree$F is approximately 26.7$\degree$C and 40$\degree$F is approximately 4.4$\degree$C
  - Is it twice as hot (80$\degree$F is two times 40$\degree$F) OR is it 6 times as hot (26.7$\degree$C is about 6 times 4.4$\degree$C)?

**Ratio: data has constant differences for interval**

**AND there is a natural "0" value that can be used as a base point for ration comparisons**
- Example: distance travelled from homw to school;
  - Asaf travels 3 miles and Ben travels 6 miles. Ben travels twice as far as Asaf
- Example: It took Tran 1.5 hours to do homework and took Li 3 hours to do homework.
  - Tran took half as long as Li to do homework.
- Distance, Weight, . . . 
___
## **EXAMPLE 2:** ## 
Identify the type of variable and data and identify the level of measurement:
#
a. Variable: "The distance that a (one, individual) student commutes to De Anza College"
Data: 2.5 miles, 8.4 miles, 0.25 miels, 52 miles, . . 

    Variable Type: Quantitative continuous
    LoM: Ratio

b. Variable: "The number of days per week that a student comes to campus"

Data: 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, . . .

    Variable Type: Quantitative Discrete
    LoM: Ratio

c. Variable: "How a De Anza student commutes to school"

Data: car, car, bus, bike, bus, walk, car, bus, bus, car, bike, car, bus

    Variable Type: Quantitative 
    LoM: Nominal

d. Variable: "Was your commute time this Friday (1) faster than, (2) same as, (3) slower than usual?"

Data: 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, . . .

    Variable Type: Qualitative 
    LoM: Ordinary
____
## **EXAMPLE 3:** ## 
1500 randomly selected registered voters in a large city are asked the following questions:
    
    what is your age?
    What is your annual incoms?    
    Do you intend to vote?  
    If you intend to vote, do you intend to vote in person or by absentee ballot?
A newspaper article discussing expected voter turnout reported that for this sample, the average annual income is $61,000, the average age is 44, 63% of the registered voters sampled intend to vote, 42% intend to vote by absentee ballot while 58% intend to vote in person at the poillingplace.
#

a.  Describe the sample:

    1500 randomly selected registered voters in a large city
#
b. What would be the appropriate target population for this sample?

    All of the registered voter in a large city
#
c. What are the variables? List each variable as quantitative or qualitative:

| The QUANTITATIVE variables are: | The QUALITATITIVE variables are: |
|:---:|:---:|
| Age | Intend to vote|
| Annual income | How to vote |
#
d. Make up examples of data that might have been given by somebody in the sample.

| Age | Income | Intend | How | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 25 | $90k | yes | In-person |
| 23 | $45k | No | | 
| 20 | $20k | Yes | Absentee ballot |
#
e. Are the values reported in the newspaper statistics or parameters? Exmplain.

    Statistic, because they are associated with a sample
