## Chapter 2: Numerical & Graphical Summaries of Quantitative Data
# Frequently Distributions and Histograms

**A HISTOGRAM is a bar graph displaying quantitative (numerical) data**
- Consecutive bars should be touching. There should not be a gap between consecutive bars.
- A "gap" should occur only if an interval does not have any lying in it.
- Vertical axis can be frequency or can be relative frequency.

### **Example 1:**
Individual Data Values

Plants are being studied in a lab experiment. The number of flowers on a plalnt, for a sample of 16 plants in this experiment are:

2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 3

| Number of Flowers | Frequency | Relative Frequency | Cumulative Relative Frequency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 4 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| 2 | 5 | 0.3125 | 0.5625 |
| 3 | 3 | 0.1875 | 0.75 |
| 4 | 2 | 0.125 | 0.875 |
| 5 | 1 | 0.0625 | 0.9375 |
| 6 | 1 | 0.0625 | 1.0 |
